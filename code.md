Here I will drop some pages and facts I have found interesting. Ideally, I would like it to become a curated list of relevant resources available on the internet. Let's see how it works in practice.

### Research
<ul>
  <li>You can access our ENF Moving Videos Database, which has been downloaded more than 500 times, <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3549379" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

  <br/>

  <li>My <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freeTools.html?version=2" target="_blank">Erdös number</a> is four: S. Fernández-Menduiña → F. Pérez-González → S. J. Miller → M. Ram Murty → P. Erdös.</li>
  
  <br/>
  <li>I found the way in which information is communicated to be an art in itself. I try (sometimes with little success) to follow some guidelines. </li>
 
</ul>
### Technical Resources
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf" target="_blanck"> The Matrix Cookbook </a> helped me very often while dealing with algebra.</li>
</ul>
