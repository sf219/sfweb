Here I will drop some pages and facts I have found interesting. Ideally, I would like it to become a curated list of relevant resources available on the internet. Let's see how it works in practice.

### Research
<ul>
  <li>You can access our ENF Moving Videos Database, which has been downloaded more than 500 times, <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3549379" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

  <br/>

  <li>My <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freeTools.html?version=2" target="_blank">Erdös number</a> is four: S. Fernández-Menduiña → F. Pérez-González → S. J. Miller → M. Ram Murty → P. Erdös.</li>
  
  <br/>
  <li>I found the way in which information is communicated to be an art in itself. I try (sometimes with little success) to follow some guidelines <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19160-7" target="_blanck"> on the use of color</a>, or while <a href="http://personal.cege.umn.edu/~smith/supplements/poster/guide.htm" target="_blanck"> preparing posters </a>, <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/support/helps/self-help-resources/presentation-skills/conference-presentations" target="_blanck">presentations</a>, and <a href="https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-018-02404-4/d41586-018-02404-4.pdf" target="_blanck">writing papers</a>. </li>
 
</ul>
### Technical Resources
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf" target="_blanck"> The Matrix Cookbook </a> helped me very often while dealing with algebra.</li>
</ul>
