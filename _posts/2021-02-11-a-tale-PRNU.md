A pervasive, almost undetectable and unnoticable pattern. The dream of any forensic analyzer. The PRNU (from Photo-Response-Non-Uniformity) is a pattern present on digital sensors.

Even though, due to the generating mechanisms of the electrical energy, when the power demand increases, the frequency decreases slightly (and conversely, when the power demand decreases the frequency increases). In large scale networks, this leads to random frequency drift, that can be considered unique in time. For instance, you may check the frequency in the European grid in real-time <a href="https://www.swissgrid.ch/en/home/operation/grid-data/current-data.html#frequency" target="_blanck">here</a>.
