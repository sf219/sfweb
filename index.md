I am a researcher at <a href="https://atlanttic.uvigo.es/" target="_blank">AtlanTTIC</a>, the center for information technologies at the University of Vigo. Currently, I am working in the intersection of signal processing and multimedia forensics techniques.  

<br />
Previously, I was a MSc student at <a href="http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/index.en.html" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>, where I collaborated with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~malik/" target="_blank">Dr. A. Bhandari</a>'s group
on the development of new information acquisition schemes.

<br />
I am also an electrical engineer by <a href="http://www.upc.edu" target="_blank">University of Vigo</a>.
